# Active Context — Train Better Hub

> Last updated: 2026-02-17

## Current State: Scaffolded + Brand/Positioning Pass Updated

The Hub repo is scaffolded with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript strict, TailwindCSS, and page stubs for all IA sections. Brand/domain messaging has been updated for ReadyAll (`readyall.org`) and core platform positioning is now explicit across Home, Products, Docs, Community, and Roadmap.

### What Exists
- Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- 10 routes: `/`, `/products`, `/athletes`, `/coaches`, `/community`, `/docs`, `/roadmap`, `/feedback`, `/support`, `/_not-found`
- Home, Products, Docs, Community, and Roadmap reflect ReadyAll positioning and transparency model
- Major component messaging now includes: Logbook Companion, ErgLink, Rowing Workout Notation (RWN), workout templates, and coaching + roster workflows
- Docs page now frames planned knowledge base focus: training plans, physiology, and technique
- Home now includes a prominent "RWN + documentation essentials" spotlight section with direct links
- Home now includes an explicit "Core platform pillars" prominence block: Logbook Companion, RWN, Coaching + Team Management, and Live Sessions (ErgLink)
- User-facing terminology updated from "Products" to "Apps" (navigation + page heading/metadata), while retaining `/products` route for URL continuity
- Docs now includes anchored sections for RWN, workout templates, training plans, physiology, and technique
- Docs content has been intentionally simplified to a scaffolded "building in public" baseline (current/next/contribute framing per section) to invite community involvement while fundamentals are established
- Docs page now includes an explicit visibility note that Hub Resources content is identical for logged-in and logged-out viewers (to reduce confusion with richer in-app authenticated surfaces)
- Added dedicated `/rwn` page to document implemented RWN parser/playground capabilities (syntax modes, structures, guidance parameters, validation/normalization, examples) and rewired key RWN links from Home/Docs/Nav/Footer to this standalone reference
- RWN reference examples are now grouped by playground categories (Basic, Pace, Advanced, Multi-Modal) with short descriptors to mirror validator UX
- Resources docs now include deeper training guidance: expanded zone intent/detail and a dedicated training concepts + periodization section (macro/meso/microcycle framing and load progression basics)
- Added a concrete 4-week build mesocycle example (with deload week) to make periodization guidance immediately actionable
- ReadyAll theme behavior now aligns with Logbook Companion style: light-first default (no OS auto dark switch) with optional dark mode via `html.dark`, plus harmonized accent tokens
- ReadyAll header now includes a live theme toggle wired to read/write `user_profiles.preferences.theme` (Supabase) for authenticated users, with local fallback storage and DB-preferred load precedence
- Docs sections are now filled with practical content extracted/synthesized from `LogbookCompanion/kb`
- Docs now cites source material for key topics (Pete Plan, Wolverine Plan, physiology/zones, technique, injury prevention)
- Training-plan citations on `/docs` now prefer external public sources (Pete Plan public page, Row2k Wolverine context, direct Wolverine Plan Scribd document, Concept2 plans index) instead of internal KB links
- Additional `/docs` citations for physiology, zones/pacing, technique, and injury sections now point to external public sources (Concept2 training references + peer-reviewed open-access physiology overview)
- Community page now includes practical contribution pathways and transparency commitments
- Community/roadmap/feedback/docs participation copy now aligned to a ReadyAll-native contribution model (non-GitHub-first) with GitHub positioned as optional implementation transparency mirror
- Community program naming updated from `Docs Guild` to `Docs Stewardship Group`
- Supabase migration added role-based moderation foundation: `public.user_has_role(required_role text)` + `community_items` + `community_votes` tables with RLS for public approved visibility, authenticated submission/voting, and moderator update access
- Legacy hard-coded admin UUID policies on `user_feedback` replaced by role-based moderator policies (`content_moderator` / `admin` via `user_profiles.roles`)
- Feedback page now includes first ReadyAll-native contribution surface with moderated submission intake + published-priority voting (`CommunityFeedbackBoard`)
- Added moderator-only queue UI at `/community/moderation` (`ModeratorQueue`) for status updates (`pending`, `in_review`, `approved`, `rejected`, `implemented`) and moderation notes
- Community requests now capture `product_area` (`readyall_hub`, `logbook_companion`, `erg_link`, `rwn`) at DB + form level for clearer routing/prioritization
- Feedback board auth UX now distinguishes real Hub session from app handoff hint: anonymous users remain read-only, and users with only auth hint are prompted to complete sign-in before write actions
- Roadmap page now includes a dedicated strategic-areas component (`StrategicRoadmap`) outlining major tracks, current status (Active/Next/Planned), and now/next intent per area
- Training & Physiology page reordered for concept progression: Physiology foundations (Energy Systems first) now precede Zones & Pacing, followed by Power Profile and Planning
- Access policy clarified across public surfaces: reading resources/roadmap/backlog is public; login gates participation actions (voting/prioritization)
- Navigation now labels `/docs` explicitly as "Docs" for clearer discoverability
- IA simplified for depth-first docs: top-level nav now removes Athletes/Coaches/RWN links, keeping Home + Apps + Docs + Community as primary discovery surfaces
- Home page now folds athlete/coach utility messaging into consolidated on-page sections instead of separate audience pages
- Docs page re-architected into a navigable documentation map with section depth/status tags (Live / Draft depth / Planned expansion)
- Added a shared "Docs depth dashboard" component on both Home and Docs to make section maturity visible at a glance and reinforce depth-over-breadth content strategy
- Added top-level `README.md` documenting ReadyAll's community-first purpose, depth-over-breadth IA direction, docs-centered architecture, and contribution guidance
- Refined messaging across README/Home/Community to emphasize ReadyAll as an open rowing resource commons: free learning, global resource curation, and enthusiast-led contribution on top of existing knowledge
- Updated Home page RWN pathway links to point directly to `/rwn` (readyall.org/rwn) instead of docs anchors for clearer user navigation
- Expanded `/rwn` into a more comprehensive reference aligned with Logbook Companion docs/playground patterns: deeper syntax/guidance sections, canonical naming behavior notes, common authoring mistakes, and a new interactive playground-style example explorer component
- Integrated `/rwn` with an LC-style two-mode workflow (`Specification Guide` + `Interactive Playground`) so ReadyAll now mirrors Logbook Companion’s docs interaction pattern instead of a single long-form static reference
- Refactored `/docs` away from broad low-value card coverage into two depth-first sections: `RWN` (complete) and `Training & Physiology` (active expansion), with significantly richer pacing/zones/power-duration/periodization content and external detailed-plan links
- Split docs architecture into a concise `/docs` index plus dedicated `/training-physiology` page; updated Home/dashboard links to route to `/rwn` and `/training-physiology` rather than removed docs anchors
- Added a sticky in-page sub-navigation on `/training-physiology` (Zones, Pacing, Power-Duration, Planning) to improve long-form docs navigation
- Aligned ReadyAll theming behavior with LC model: added `system` theme preference, resolved-theme application with OS preference listener, and hardened DB persistence of `user_profiles.preferences.theme` via upsert
- Added Hub auth-status visibility after LC round-trip: new header `AuthStatus` component checks Supabase user and an `authState=signedIn` handoff hint, so the UI no longer remains static on "Sign In" after successful redirect flow
- Products page LC CTA is now auth-aware: if signed in, link targets LC home (`/`); if not signed in, link targets LC public `about` page (`/about`)
- Header `Open App` CTA now uses the same auth-aware LC routing logic as Products (signed in → `/`, signed out → `/about`) for consistent behavior site-wide
- Community-facing GitHub tracking links (feedback, support, community issue tracker, roadmap board placeholder) now point to `gamalamadingdong/readyall` so Hub work is tracked in the Hub repo
- Docs index layout redesigned to remove redundancy and awkward "docs depth dashboard" wording: now framed as `Documentation Progress` + `Current Tracks` + `Future Expansion Model` + contribution CTAs, while preserving two-track depth-first architecture
- Updated RWN validator CTA to deep-link into LC docs playground tab (`/docs?tab=rwn&rwnSubTab=playground`) once LC tab-linking support landed
- RWN is now positioned as a docs-domain topic (linked from Docs/Home docs pathways) rather than a primary global nav destination
- Legacy audience URLs `/athletes` and `/coaches` now redirect to Home to preserve continuity while reducing top-level IA complexity
- Roadmap now includes a "References" subsection linking to key KB and planning sources
- Unified auth verification pass completed before push: Hub LC fallback URLs normalized to `logbook.train-better.app` across CTA surfaces
- Final pre-push auth hardening: Hub auth fallback LC base now defaults to `https://logbook.readyall.org`; auth allowlist includes `https://logbook.readyall.org`; `.env.example` cross-app URLs aligned to readyall domains
- Global metadata/header/footer brand labels updated to ReadyAll
- Auth hub fallback URL now defaults to `https://readyall.org` with `readyall.org`/`www.readyall.org` in origin allowlist
- Unified auth entry route `/auth` redirects to LC login with validated `returnTo`
- Auth redirect allowlist includes new production domains and temporary legacy LC Vercel domain
- Loop protection in `/auth` via `authHop` threshold and unsafe auth-path guardrails
- `/training-physiology` fully rewritten: color-coded zone cards with integrated pacing targets (pace/rate/volume share per zone, with a 2:00 example baseline), 80/20 volume distribution bar, pacing derivation callout, standalone pacing section removed, subnav updated (Zones & Pacing | Power Profile | Planning)
- Power Profile section massively expanded: conceptual power curve bar chart, full anchor-ratio reference table (9 anchors from 1:00→HM with expected % of 2k watts + energy system + what-it-tests), 4 profile types (Sprinter/Diesel/Threshold Gap/Balanced) with training implications, deviation-from-expected illustrated bar chart (sprinter example), 3-step how-to-build guide, and why-it-matters comparison card (with vs without power profiling)
- Shared type convention: `src/lib/types/` (database, shared, supabase, barrel)
- Supabase client wired (needs `.env` with real keys)
- `.env.example` with all expected vars
- `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`
- `working-memory/` docs

### What's Next

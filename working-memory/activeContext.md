# Active Context — Train Better Hub

> Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Current State: Scaffolded + Brand/Positioning Pass Updated

The Hub repo is scaffolded with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript strict, TailwindCSS, and page stubs for all IA sections. Brand/domain messaging has been updated for ReadyAll (`readyall.org`) and core platform positioning is now explicit across Home, Products, Docs, Community, and Roadmap.

### What Exists
- Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- 10 routes: `/`, `/products`, `/athletes`, `/coaches`, `/community`, `/docs`, `/roadmap`, `/feedback`, `/support`, `/_not-found`
- Home, Products, Docs, Community, and Roadmap reflect ReadyAll positioning and transparency model
- Major component messaging now includes: Logbook Companion, ErgLink, Rowing Workout Notation (RWN), workout templates, and coaching + roster workflows
- Docs page now frames planned knowledge base focus: training plans, physiology, and technique
- Home now includes a prominent "RWN + documentation essentials" spotlight section with direct links
- Docs now includes anchored sections for RWN, workout templates, training plans, physiology, and technique
- Docs sections are now filled with practical content extracted/synthesized from `LogbookCompanion/kb`
- Docs now cites source material for key topics (Pete Plan, Wolverine Plan, physiology/zones, technique, injury prevention)
- Community page now includes practical contribution pathways and transparency commitments
- Access policy clarified across public surfaces: reading resources/roadmap/backlog is public; login gates participation actions (voting/prioritization)
- Navigation now labels `/docs` explicitly as "Docs" for clearer discoverability
- Roadmap now includes a "References" subsection linking to key KB and planning sources
- Unified auth verification pass completed before push: Hub LC fallback URLs normalized to `logbook.train-better.app` across CTA surfaces
- Final pre-push auth hardening: Hub auth fallback LC base now defaults to `https://logbook.readyall.org`; auth allowlist includes `https://logbook.readyall.org`; `.env.example` cross-app URLs aligned to readyall domains
- Global metadata/header/footer brand labels updated to ReadyAll
- Auth hub fallback URL now defaults to `https://readyall.org` with `readyall.org`/`www.readyall.org` in origin allowlist
- Unified auth entry route `/auth` redirects to LC login with validated `returnTo`
- Auth redirect allowlist includes new production domains and temporary legacy LC Vercel domain
- Loop protection in `/auth` via `authHop` threshold and unsafe auth-path guardrails
- Shared type convention: `src/lib/types/` (database, shared, supabase, barrel)
- Supabase client wired (needs `.env` with real keys)
- `.env.example` with all expected vars
- `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`
- `working-memory/` docs

### What's Next
- [x] Scaffold Next.js App Router project (TypeScript, TailwindCSS)
- [x] Set up shared type convention (`src/lib/types/`)
- [x] Create page stubs for IA
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment for `readyall.org`
- [ ] Wire up Supabase Auth (shared project) — add real env vars
- [ ] Continue refining remaining page depth (Athletes, Feedback, Support)
- [ ] Add baseline Hub analytics events for key CTAs (`open_logbook`, `open_erglink`, `open_docs`, `open_feedback`)
- [ ] Add `next/link` navigation (replace `<a>` tags for internal links)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive nav (hamburger menu)
- [x] Unified auth execution (Phase 1 foundation): Hub `/auth` route + LC `returnTo` contract
- [x] Unified auth hardening: loop protection + redirect metadata propagation
- [ ] Unified auth observability dashboarding (wire telemetry events into analytics sink)

### Blockers
- Subdomain/domain alignment still pending for remaining app endpoints (LC/EL), currently still on legacy hostnames
